                <img src="Loreal.webp" alt="Company Overview">
                <p>In the early 20th century, Eugène Paul Louis Schueller (1881–1957), a young French chemist, developed a hair dye formula called Oréale. Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he sold to Parisian hairdressers. On 31 July 1909, Schueller registered his company,[7] the Société Française de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The company eventually became L'Oréal. In 1920, the company employed three chemists; the number of employees continued to grow with 100 by the year 1950, and 1,000 by the year 1984; as recently as 2021, there was an estimated total of 85,252 worldwide.[8]
                   L'Oréal got its start in the hair-color business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. As of 2020, L'Oréal markets in all sectors of the beauty business: hair color, permanents, hair styling, body and skincare, cleansers, makeup, and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide variety of outlets, from hair salons and perfumeries to supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies, and direct mail.</p>
